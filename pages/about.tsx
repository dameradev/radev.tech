                <p className='leading-[3rem] text-lg'>
                  Hello, world! I'm Damjan, a creative developer and curious
                  learner. My journey started back in my last year at the
                  university. As a Business major, I realized I wanted something
                  different, something challenging yet fulfilling. The seeds of
                  change were sown, and I embarked on a path towards becoming a
                  web developer. I took a deep dive into coding, starting with
                  Ruby, and fell in love with the logic, the problem-solving,
                  and the ability to bring ideas to life.
                </p>

                <p className='leading-[3rem] text-lg'>
                  Over the years, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in HTML5, CSS3,
                  SCSS/SASS, and JavaScript, building responsive websites that
                  prioritize user experience. I've embraced the power of modern
                  technologies such as ReactJS (including React Hooks), Material
                  UI, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, Gatsby.js, and GraphQL to create
                  dynamic, engaging, and interactive digital experiences.

                <h2 className='text-4xl mb-4'>The Backend Expertise</h2>
                <p className='leading-[3rem] text-lg'>
                  But my skills don't end at the user interface. Recognizing the
                  importance of the complete web ecosystem, I immersed myself in
                  backend technologies, mastering Node.js, Prisma, and GraphQL.
                  I've also built custom content management systems (CMS) that
                  empower non-technical users to manage their website content
                  with ease. I've worked with Shopify, Sanity, Strapi, Keystone,
                  and Prismic, aiming to provide a smooth and efficient content
                  management process for my clients.

                <h2 className='text-4xl mb-4'>The Freelancer</h2>
                <p className='leading-[3rem] text-lg'>
                  I took my skills to the digital marketplace, becoming a
                  freelancer on Upwork. Starting from the humble beginnings of
                  an $8/hour gig, I've now made my way to $50/hour contracts,
                  always learning and improving along the way. The freelance
                  life has allowed me the freedom to work from anywhere, at any
                  time, and the joy of making a difference in diverse projects.

                <h2 className='text-4xl mb-4'>The Mindful Coder</h2>
                <p className='leading-[3rem] text-lg'>
                  Beyond the codes and scripts, I'm an ardent practitioner of
                  mindfulness. I believe in the power of staying present, of
                  being in the moment. This practice has not only enriched my
                  personal life but also my professional one. It enables me to
                  stay focused, handle the pressures of coding challenges, and
                  maintain a harmonious work-life balance.

                <p className='leading-[3rem] text-lg'>
                  As technology evolves, so do I. My interest in generative AI
                  and its applications in the creative field is driving me
                  towards exploring new dimensions. I'm also excited about the
                  potential of video as a medium to share knowledge and connect
                  with others. In the end, I'm just a guy who loves to solve
                  problems, enjoys the process of creation, and is excited about
                  what technology can do to make our lives better. If you have a
                  project you'd like to discuss or just want to chat about the
                  latest in tech, feel free to get in touch. I'm always up for a
                  good conversation.
